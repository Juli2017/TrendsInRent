Median Gross Rent values are not inflaction adjusted.
Prior to 2015, the American Community Survey reported all median gross rent values by ZCTA that were over $2,000 per month as "2000+".  For the purposes of the visualization above, these were changed to 2,000, and the highest category shown is >=$2,000.
The value shown in the information box for these cases is $2,000 which may under-report the actual value.  For 2015, the actual median gross rent is shown.
